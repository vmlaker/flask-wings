# flask-wings

Flask-Wings is a boilerplate for writing Flask extensions.

It itself is a tiny Flask extension that just adds some views and templates to the parent Flask application. An example of how to use it is in file ```tests/app.py```.

Use Flask-Wings as a starting point for creating your own Flask extension Python packages.

In addition to the boilerplate code, it includes some extras you can adopt to make your Flask extension agree with standard practices:

* setuptools configuration file
* tests directory
* a makefile


## Developers

Take a look at the Makefile.
